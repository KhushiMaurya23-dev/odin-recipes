# Odin Recipes

This is my first project, **"Odin Recipes"**, built for **The Odin Project** ([https://www.theodinproject.com/](https://www.theodinproject.com/)) as part of its foundation course.


## Skills Learned

Through this project, I have **practically learned basic HTML**, including:  
- HTML boilerplate (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<meta>`, `<title>`, `<body>`)  
- Common tags (`<p>`, `<h1>`–`<h6>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<b>`, `<br>`)  
- List tags (`<ol>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`)  
- Link tag (`<a>`) with `href` attributes (absolute and relative)  
- Media tag (`<img>`) with `src` and `alt` attributes
   

## Project Overview

In this project, I used all these **basic HTML skills** to create a **Recipes Project** based on day-to-day staple foods, commonly called **"Desi Khana"** in South Asia.

**Desi Khana** includes foods commonly eaten in South-Asian households:  
- **Dal** (lentils)  
- **Bhaat** (cooked rice)  
- **Bhaaji** (vegetable curry)  
- **Roti** (flatbreads)  

The **main page** describes these foods in detail, and each food has its **own page with detailed recipes**.
