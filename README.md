This is my First Project named 'Odin Recipes". I build it for and through The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/) as part of its foundation course.
Through this project, i have practically learn basic html like html boilerplate(html,head, meta, title, body), common html tag (p,h1-h6,em,strong, b, br), list tag(ol, ul, li), link tag(a, atrribute href and absolute relative) and common media(img, attribute src, alt ),
In this project "Odin Recipes", I have use all this basic html for creating Recipes Project.
This Recipe Project is based on day-to-day staple food, in layman word's it's called "Desi Khana".
"Desi Khana" includes commonly and day-to-day eaten food in every South-Asian household such as Dal(lentil), Bhaat(Cooked Rice), Bhaaji (Vegetable Curry) and Roti(FlatBreads)
Project's Main Page is based on descriping this foods in detail
Every food has it's own page describing them and their recipe in great detail!
